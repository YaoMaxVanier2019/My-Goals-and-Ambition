# My-Goals-and-Ambition
A description of my ambition in the world of CS or Engineering.

My name is Max. I am a grade 11 student. I go to Georges Vanier Secondary School. I am currently attending the Computer Science course.
My goal is to simply learn as much as I can. I have great passion for playing video games, therefore so am I for how they are coded. Although I may not necessarily take on any programming based jobs in the future, I still wish to be able to take something away from this course.
